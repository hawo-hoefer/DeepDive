<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is for a lecture at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. It aims at mechanical engineers diving into deep learning and enabling to get their hands dirty on some practical application of deep learning. 

Here's why this project fits so well for this:
* The project is an interactive jupyter notebook, which makes it easy to walk through the explanations, run the code and immediately experience the change
* The project is hosted on binder so there is no setup necessary and students can directly run the project in their browser
* It covers a fundamental PyTorch tutorial on MNIST, including essential validation approaches

Of course, no one project will serve all levels of expertice since your needs may be different. This is an attempt to kickstart rookies. You may also contribute or suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this project so far! You started your own deep learning projects and wonder 'why does my neural network not learn?' - here are the [coffee table solutions](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B09QRGWWZP) of my dear colleague and creator of this project Mark Schutera.

The notebook is hosted on [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hawo-hoefer/DeepDive/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2FDeepDive.ipynb)
